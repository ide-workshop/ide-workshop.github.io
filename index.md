## Call for submissions

Despite the research community’s desire to improve the productivity of software developers, 
it is challenging for research to move beyond papers into the everyday practice of software development.
Since IDEs are one of the most widely used tools in developers’ toolkit, they remain a crucial venue 
for research to reach software developers. To close the gap between research and adoption in practice, 
we are launching the first edition of the **IDE workshop**. 

At our workshop, we are equipping the academic researchers with practical insights you need to 
successfully deploy your research through IDE plugins. We also aim to inspire academic educators and 
provide resources you can use to augment your teaching toolkit, so you can effectively teach SE concepts 
through IDE features. We are connecting you with IDE builders that share insights and best practices, 
and show previews of upcoming IDE features. 

Join us to learn from evidence-based best practices that colleagues in academia follow when conducting 
research through IDE features. We invite you to share your perspective and identify entry-barriers and 
promising ideas from the research community so that IDE builders can make informed decisions on how IDEs 
could best serve the research, development, and education community. Join us and rub shoulders with a 
community of researchers and IDE builders that are committed to go the extra mile to move research into 
practice. 

### Topics of interest

Our target audience includes **both academic researchers/educators and IDE developers from industry**.

**From the research side**, we welcome any contributions that relate to IDEs, in the form of short 
research papers (up to 4 pages + 1 page for references) or shorter position papers (1–2 pages + 1 page
for references). The topics include, but are not limited to:

* The development of plugins, add-ons, and extensions for IDEs.
* Integrating prototypes or machine learning models into the IDEs.
* Improving various IDE features, such as automated refactorings, quick fixes, etc.
* Program analysis and static analysis inside the IDE.
* UI/UX studies of working in the IDE, analyzing the way people use IDEs, their workflow, activities, 
attention, eye movement, etc.
* Visualizations in the IDEs.
* Using IDEs to analyze software development activities by collecting usage data, _e.g._, 
logs, datasets of interactions.
* Insights and case studies of teaching various SE concepts (_e.g._, program comprehension, 
refactoring, testing, debugging, etc.) using IDEs.
* Anecdotal experience about why a certain tool or research approach was not implemented on top of 
the IDE infrastructure but researchers chose alternatives (_e.g._, a CLI tool), what the blockers 
were, and how the IDEs can improve to become more convenient for prototyping.
* And others!

**From the industry side**, we invite the developers of IDEs to share their perspective. Since industry 
participants might not be familiar with writing academic papers, we invite them to contribute short position 
papers (1-2 pages + 1 page for references). What's more, they can be submitted in free form, if needed, 
and we ourselves can help with their formatting. The topics include, but are not limited to:

* What exactly IDE builders are looking for in contributions from the research community and how 
they try to incorporate them.
* What researchers can do to increase the chance of integration into the existing IDEs.
* Upcoming or undocumented features and infrastructure in the IDEs that researchers can use to 
accelerate their research development or could use for education.

We are open to the developers of other industrial solutions that operate outside IDEs (_e.g._, as 
standalone services) to understand what precludes tighter integration with IDEs. 
If you are interested in simplifying the deployment of research outcomes as IDE plugins, have an idea 
on improving the IDEs that needs research, or are simply curious about the latest advancements in 
software engineering research, come join us in meeting users & fellow developers.

We invited developers and project managers of several IDEs (IntelliJ, Visual Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans, 
VS Code, AndroidStudio, etc.) to hopefully foster a fruitful discussion that can result in practical 
collaborations. Please join us, share your perspective, and take part in growing the community that 
cares about practical impact and improving the lives of software developers!

### Submission process

The information about the paper template and the relevant ACM/IEEE policies can be found on the 
[main ICSE page with submission information](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2024/icse-2024-research-track#submission-process) (please note the necessary options to turn the paper into two columns).
The IDE workshop employs the **single-blind** review process, _i.e._, you do not need to conceal your identity.
The workshop accepts short research papers (4 pages + 1 page for references) and shorter position 
papers (1-2 pages + 1 page for references). 

Papers must be submitted electronically via by the defined deadline (see important dates below) on **EasyChair**: 
[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ide24](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ide24). At least one author of each accepted paper should register for the
workshop and present the paper in the workshop. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact
the proceedings chair for any inquiries (see contacts below).

The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made
available in the ACM Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2024.
The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

### Important dates

* Papers submission deadline: ~~November 9th, 2023~~ **December 7th, 2023**
* Papers acceptance notification: ~~December 21st, 2023~~ January 11th, 2024
* Camera ready deadline: January 25th, 2024
* Workshop: TBD
