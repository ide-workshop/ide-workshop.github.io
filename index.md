## About the workshop

The 3rd International Workshop on Integrated Development Environments (the IDE Workshop) is the prime venue for uniting researchers
and practitioners in their shared passion for IDEs and developers' productivity. 
The previous editions of the workshop ([IDE'24](https://ide-workshop.github.io/content/ide-2024.html) 
and [IDE'25](https://ide-workshop.github.io/content/ide-2025.html)) attracted many papers and
resulted in fantastic discussions! In our post-workshop survey, the participants commented
on the value they received, saying:
* _"A lot of meaningful connections, including academy-to-industry,
  inspiring discussions"_,
* _"Lively and friendly atmosphere! The strong industry presence definitely makes
  discussing the topics more interesting"_.

You can find a more detailed list
of topics of interest in the _Call for submissions_ below. The workshop is co-located with [ICSE'26](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2026).

## Call for submissions

Despite the desire of the research community to improve the productivity of software developers, 
it is challenging for research to move beyond papers into the everyday practice of software development. 
Since IDEs are among the most widely used tools in developersâ€™ toolkit, they remain a crucial opportunity 
for research to reach this goal. To close the gap between research and adoption in practice, 
we launched the IDE workshop series. We build upon the momentum from our first two editions of the workshop and aim 
to exceed expectations at our third instance at ICSE'26.

At our workshop, we aim to bring together researchers and practitioners, and foster the community that really _cares_
about IDEs. The researchers can exchange their ideas about using IDEs as a means for their work, as well as
inspire each other on how to push the IDEs to the max: different visualizations, different ways of interacting with the users,
unconventional methods of employing IDEs for data collection, for education, etc. In the meantime, having IDE developers in the mix allows
the conversation to remain practical: IDE developers can learn state-of-the-art science but also communicate
what it is they look for in research. Let's shape this community together!

### Topics of interest

Our target audience includes **both academic researchers and IDE developers from industry**.

**From the research side**, we welcome any contributions that relate to IDEs, in the form of **short 
research papers** (up to 6 pages, including references) or shorter **extended abstracts** (up to 4 pages, including references, [**free of APC charges**](https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/article-types)). 
The topics include, but are not limited to:

* The development of plugins, add-ons, and extensions for IDEs.
* Integrating prototypes or machine learning models into the IDEs.
* Using advanced AI, LLMs, AI agents, etc. in the IDEs.
* Improving various IDE features, such as automated refactorings, quick fixes, etc.
* Program and static analysis inside the IDE.
* UI/UX studies of working in the IDE, analyzing the way people use IDEs, their workflow, activities, attention, eye movement, etc.
* Visualizations in the IDEs.
* Using IDEs to analyze software development activities by collecting usage data.
* Insights and case studies of teaching various SE concepts (_e.g._, program comprehension, refactoring, 
testing, debugging, etc.) using IDEs.
* Different types of IDEs, unusual coding formats, novel IDE paradigms, and other potential visions of the future for the field.
* Anecdotal experience about why a certain tool or research approach was not implemented on top of IDE infrastructure, 
what the blockers were, and how the IDEs can improve to become more convenient for prototyping.
* And others!


**From industry**, we invite the developers of IDEs to share:

* What exactly they are looking for in contributions from the research community.
* What researchers can do to increase the chance of integration into the existing IDEs.
* Insights about IDEs that researchers can use to accelerate their research development or could use for education.

We are open to the developers of other industrial solutions that operate outside IDEs (_e.g._, as 
standalone services) to understand what precludes tighter integration with the rest of the development tooling and how 
IDEs can improve.

We want to foster an inclusive community that is welcoming not only established academic researchers but also 
industry participants who might not be familiar with writing academic papers. Thus, we invite IDE builders to 
contribute short **extended abstracts** (up to 4 pages, including references, [**free of APC charges**](https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/article-types)) in free form, 
and we ourselves can help with their formatting.

We invited developers and project managers of several IDEs (IntelliJ, Visual Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans, VS Code, 
AndroidStudio, etc.) to foster a fruitful discussion that can result in practical collaborations. Please join us, 
share your perspective, and take part in growing the community that cares about practical impact and improving the 
lives of software developers!

### Submission process

The information about the paper template and the relevant ACM/IEEE policies can be found on the 
[main ICSE page with submission information](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2026/icse-2026-research-track#submission-process).
Submissions must conform to the [ACM Proceedings Template page](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).
The following LaTeX code can be placed at the start of the LaTeX document: `\documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}`.

The IDE workshop employs the **single-blind** review process, _i.e._, you do not need to conceal your identity.
The workshop accepts:
* **short research papers** (up to 6 pages, including references) 
* **extended abstracts** (up to 4 pages, including references, [**free of APC charges**](https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/article-types)). 

Purchases of additional pages in the proceedings are not allowed.

Papers must be submitted electronically by the defined deadline (see important dates below) on **HotCrp**: **TBA**. 
If your paper is accepted, the list of authors cannot be changed but mistakes in the author names can be fixed. Titles can be changed with the approval of the program chairs.
At least one author of each accepted paper should register for the
workshop and present the paper at the workshop. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact
the general chair for any inquiries (see contacts below).

The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM or IEEE Digital Libraries. 
This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2026. 
The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

### Important dates

* Papers submission deadline: **October 20th, 2025**
* Papers acceptance notification:  November 24th, 2025
* Camera ready deadline: TBA
* Workshop: TBA
